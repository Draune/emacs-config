# Introduction

This is my first configuration from scratch. I wanted to understand how to do Elisp and get something that I can modify to my likings.

I want to keep my configuration the simpliest as I can, I don't search to optimize it, just to keep an sane amount of packages (the fact to see over 150 packages in Centaur or Doom was a little overwhelming). For this purpose, I also keep my config in a single file (because I don't want to search between files where I setup something).

I try to comment my code and keep track of my changes with the comments at the start of the file, even if I think Elisp is very self-explenatory.

I place it in .emacs.d but it can be as well used as .emacs file since it is a single file.

I will not place screenshots since my layout is pretty much just Emacs with the ef-melissa-light theme from ef-themes.

# Some other info about my config that I find amusing or "important"

I use Devil key bindings that I find very fun to use, and had replaced ", m" by ", ," for "M-" because I think it is simplier to double tap the coma than to reach the "m" key or than to use a different key for Meta (like using ";").

I configured something similar to vertico using just native ido modes (using Emacs 30.1) and I was surprised how concise it was (just 2 lines).
